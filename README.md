-- SkRPG --

This skript adds mechanics with rpg stats, custom action bar and more !
There's also some addons for this skript to add event more features :)

Please install SkBee, Skript-reflect and Skript 2.8.+ 

-- How to install --

>- Drag all content in folder "Put this in folder plugins" to plugins/
>- Drag all content in folder "Put this in scripts" to plugins/Skript/scripts
>- Execute /sk reload SkRPG/!SkRPG
>- Done !

  Note: When SkRpg loads, you may see 1 or 2 errors. Ignore them.
  (It's because of the way Skripts loads everything before custom
  events I made with skript-reflect. Just ignore !)
